# Project 2

# part_a.py

Estimation of the coupling constant using linear regression and the MLP, a grid search is used to find the optimal parameters
code is in part_a.py

# part_b.py 

Classification of the phase of the two-dimensional Ising model using logistic regression and again the MLP, and again a grid search is used to find the optimal parameters

# functions.py

here are the codes for the linear regression, the bootstrap and code for plotting the data.

# logistic_regression.py

Object oriented implementation of logistic regression

# mlp.py

Object oriented implementation of a Multi-Layer Perceptron
